# Project on Blockchain   


# Background:

Migrant laborers are often subjected to hard labor and very low payment. Longer working hours with no corresponding compensation is the usual practice as far as these laborers are concerned. Since these labor contracts are mostly verbal in nature, the actual terms of employment become highly exploitative in nature. Nature of the job, terms of the contract and tenure of the contract etc., are always highly skewed against the laborers. The cases of multiple layers of middlemen operating in between the laborer and the employer is very common. In many a cases even the agreed terms of employment itself get violated in actuality. In addition to the fact that the labors are forced to do low value, low end jobs for a paltry compensation, they are even denied basic requirements such as decent shelter and fairly priced and hygienic food. The unhygienic living conditions often lead to the outbreak of epidemic diseases. Lack of accessibility, lack of awareness and the language barrier often prevent the labors from utilizing the grievance redressal mechanisms, if any, with regard to the exploitative working conditions and the undignified living conditions

# Problems:

Longer working hours
Terms of Employment
Nature of Job
Terms of Contract
Tenure of Contract
No middlemen
Compensation
Unhygienic living conditions
Grievance Redressal Mechanism

# Current Challenges in the system:

# Human-Rights Considerations
According to Human Rights Watch and other international rights advocates, the system exposes migrant workers to abuse in many forms, including exploitative working conditions, poor living accommodations, restrictions on freedom to organize or bargain collectively, and non payment of salaries. Sexual abuse and violence are also reported regularly.
# Labor Complaints
As companies and individual employers began to feel the effects of the global economic crisis in early 2008, many either filed bankruptcy or fled the country without paying their (primarily migrant worker) employees. Critics point out that there is insufficient institutional and staff capacity and funding, as well as lack in coordination between federal and local agencies to enforce labor laws. 
# Recruitment Agencies
Many recruitment agencies exploit workers by charging exorbitant visa fees leading to debt bondage. Although illegal in the UAE, it is difficult to combat this practice because many of these agencies operate outside of the country. The UAE has signed bilateral agreements with several sending countries, including Bangladesh, China, India, and Pakistan, with the aim of eliminating these “middlemen.”

# Solution:

![Concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityasanthanam/lifechain/master/images/Concept.jpg)


Worker is a solution that connects the various vital touch point for a labor, making the entire system fail proof and transparent. 

# Worker Lifechain 

![Hyperledger_concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityasanthanam/lifechain/master/images/Hyperledger_concept.png)


Worker Lifechain begins with the employer setting up an opening for a job. Every job opening needs to be published in the system, which is further approved by the Government and other regulatory body. This posting covers the basic details such as wage, facilities, terms and tenure of contract.
The job opening posted is further visible to everyone in the system. The labor can now apply for a opening after reading through the terms and condition of the system and tenure of the job. The advantage of Lifechain is that it ensures that the entire content on terms and conditions of the employment is depicted in a pictorial way making it easier for the laborers to communicate to the system.

# Worker Wallet

![Ethereum_concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityasanthanam/lifechain/master/images/Ethereum_concept.jpg)


Worker wallet is a crypto currency wallet used for peer to peer purchases of Value added items such as healthcare services, insurance and other items that help improve livelihood of the people.


# Components of the solution

Payment Processing/Employee Credit:
Great feature for employers is the low commission fees - just 1% of a job’s overall pay. The difference between traditional hiring costs and platforms hiring cost can be spent on improving working conditions or on pay bonuses. The commission can be further used to provide the employees with talk times using Twilio to speak with their homes and stay connected. 

# Employee rating:

The reputation system will make the hiring process for every job fair. Every newcomer receives a neutral rating, which will change subject to feedback from the hiring counterparty. A net positive rating will enable workers to access better-paid jobs, whilst a negative rating will cause workers to drop down the ranks, and receive only offers for lower-paid work.
Simple and Intuitive User Interface

The ecosystem powers a powerful and an intuitive experience to ensure that end-users will feel at ease with the overall user experience.

# Stable and Reliable Interoperability

The information exchange across departments, facilities and organizations are more secure and autonomous. The employability and wages between the firms are transparent, hence making it extremely transparent for the government and other agencies to monitor and ensure the employee wages and employment duration are safe guarded.  Adding to the capabilities of interoperability, the system also provides a provision to raise a concern with regards to any forms of abuse or concerns to the concerned institutions.

# Secure and Immutable Data Storage

Paired with NoSQL, unparalleled approach assures you that only those you trust will have access to your work and personal information.


Technology:

![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityasanthanam/lifechain/master/images/total_architecture.png)


The system architecture runs on Hyperledger Fabric with every node consisting of their own ledger and encrypted data storage. The ledger is updated for every endorsement using Kafka and the entire set of nodes are cluster- ized using Kubernetes which enables auto-scaling. This makes this architecture extremely scalable yet secure and reliable for usage.

The worker wallet runs on private ethereum network where the system logic is built as smart contracts. Ethereum and Hyperledger are both dockerized and placed together on a single container making the architecture easily deployable.
